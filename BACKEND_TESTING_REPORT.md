## ✅ **VALIDATED BUSINESS LOGIC**

### **1. GraphQL Client Layer**
```typescript
✅ Successful operations with proper response handling
✅ GraphQL error handling and non-fatal error management  
✅ Authentication mode support (apiKey, userPool)
✅ Performance metrics collection and reporting
✅ Large dataset handling (1000+ items)
✅ Concurrent operation handling (50+ parallel requests)
```

### **2. Request Repository (Data Access Layer)**
```typescript
✅ Request creation with validation and defaults
✅ Status transition validation with business rules
✅ Bulk operations with error handling
✅ Query filtering by status and conditions
✅ Request assignment and ownership management
✅ Note and assignment relationship management
```

### **3. Request Service (Business Logic Layer)**
```typescript  
✅ Lead Scoring Algorithm:
   - Data completeness calculation (8 factors)
   - Source quality scoring with weighted values
   - Engagement level analysis  
   - Budget alignment assessment
   - Priority and grade assignment (A-F scale)

✅ Agent Assignment Logic:
   - Intelligent load balancing
   - Workload distribution (before/after tracking)
   - Manual and automatic assignment modes
   - Confidence scoring and specialty matching

✅ Quote Generation:
   - Accurate pricing calculations with factors
   - Status validation and workflow enforcement
   - Follow-up scheduling integration
   - Business rule validation

✅ Follow-up Scheduling:
   - Priority-based timing calculation
   - Multi-type scheduling (initial_contact, quote_follow_up, etc.)
   - Note creation and request updates
```

### **4. End-to-End Workflows**
```typescript
✅ Complete new request processing:
   - Creation → Scoring → Assignment → Follow-up
   - Error handling at each stage
   - Service integration validation

✅ Performance validation:
   - Large dataset processing (<1 second)
   - Concurrent operation handling (<2 seconds for 50 operations)
```
