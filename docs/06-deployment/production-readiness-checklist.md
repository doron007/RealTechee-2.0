# Production Readiness Checklist

**Purpose**: Validate production deployment readiness before going live.

## 🎯 **Pre-Deployment Validation**

### **1. Environment Separation ✅**
```bash
# Verify complete isolation between dev and production
./scripts/validate-environment.sh

# Expected: ✅ No shared resources detected
# Expected: ✅ Environment configuration is valid
```

### **2. Data Integrity ✅**
```bash
# Backup production data before any changes
./scripts/backup-data.sh

# Validate data consistency
node scripts/check-data.mjs --validate-integrity
```

### **3. Security Configuration ✅**
```bash
# Test secret accessibility
./scripts/deploy-with-protection.sh --environment prod --skip-checks

# Expected output:
# ✓ /amplify/TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID accessible
# ✓ /amplify/SENDGRID_API_KEY accessible
# ✅ All production secrets validated
```

### **4. Build & Type Safety ✅**
```bash
# Zero TypeScript errors required
npm run type-check

# Production build must succeed
npm run build
```

### **5. Comprehensive Testing ✅**
```bash
# All E2E tests must pass
CI=true npx playwright test --reporter=line

# Expected: 100% pass rate across all test suites
```

### **6. Performance Validation ✅**
- [ ] Bundle size optimized (<300KB target)
- [ ] API response times <200ms
- [ ] Database auto-scaling configured
- [ ] CDN distribution active

### **7. Monitoring Setup ✅**
```bash
# Validate monitoring configuration
aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --region us-west-1 --alarm-name-prefix "RealTechee-Production"

# Expected: All critical alarms configured and active
```

## 🚀 **Deployment Execution**

### **Safe Deployment Process**
```bash
# 1. Final validation
./scripts/validate-environment.sh

# 2. Backup current state
./scripts/backup-data.sh

# 3. Deploy with protection
./scripts/deploy-with-protection.sh --environment prod

# 4. Post-deployment health check
# Check all critical user flows manually
```

### **Post-Deployment Verification**
- [ ] Application accessible at production URL
- [ ] Form submissions working correctly
- [ ] Admin dashboard functional
- [ ] Notification system operational
- [ ] Database queries responding correctly
- [ ] Authentication system working
- [ ] All critical user workflows tested

## 🚨 **Failure Response**

### **If Any Check Fails**
1. **STOP** deployment immediately
2. Document the failure
3. Fix the issue in development
4. Re-run complete checklist
5. Only proceed when ALL checks pass

### **Emergency Rollback**
```bash
# If production issues detected post-deployment
./scripts/execute-rollback.sh --version LAST_KNOWN_GOOD
```

## 📋 **Go/No-Go Decision Matrix**

| Category | Status | Blocker? |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Environment Separation | ✅/❌ | YES |
| Data Backup Complete | ✅/❌ | YES |
| Security Secrets Valid | ✅/❌ | YES |
| TypeScript Compilation | ✅/❌ | YES |
| Production Build | ✅/❌ | YES |
| E2E Tests Pass | ✅/❌ | YES |
| Monitoring Active | ✅/❌ | YES |

**GO/NO-GO Rule**: ALL items must be ✅ before production deployment.

*This checklist must be completed and validated before every production deployment. No exceptions.*
