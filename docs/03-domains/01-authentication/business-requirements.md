# Authentication Domain - Business Requirements

## Overview

The Authentication domain provides secure user identity management, role-based access control, and session management for the RealTechee 2.0 platform. This domain ensures that users can securely access the system with appropriate permissions based on their role in the real estate preparation workflow.

## Business Context

### **Primary Business Driver**
Enable secure, role-based access to the platform while maintaining excellent user experience and enterprise-grade security standards.

### **Key Stakeholders**
- **End Users**: Homeowners, agents, account executives, project managers
- **Administrators**: Super admins, system administrators  
- **Business Operations**: Office managers, accounting staff
- **Compliance Teams**: Security, audit, and regulatory compliance

## User Role Matrix

### **Role-Based Access Control (8 User Types)**

| **Role** | **Primary Function** | **System Access** | **Data Access** | **Key Permissions** |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Super Admin** | Complete system control | Full platform | All data | User management, system configuration, data access |
| **Admin** | Platform management | Administrative interfaces | Business data | User management, content management, reporting |
| **Accounting** | Financial operations | Financial interfaces | Financial data | Invoice management, payment tracking, financial reporting |
| **SRM** | Sales relationship management | Client management | Client projects | Assignment control, client communication, project oversight |
| **AE (Account Executive)** | Request processing | Admin interfaces | Assigned requests | Request processing, client communication, quote creation |
| **PM (Project Manager)** | Project execution | Project interfaces | Assigned projects | Project management, progress updates, client communication |
| **Agent** | Real estate professional | Limited admin access | Own referrals | Referral tracking, client relationship management |
| **Homeowner** | Property owner | Client portal | Own projects | Project viewing, communication, document access |

## Authorization Requirements

### **Role-Based Permissions**

**Data Access Patterns**:
```yaml
Data Access Matrix:
├── Super Admin:
│   ├── All users: Full CRUD operations
│   ├── All projects: Complete access and management
│   ├── All financial data: Revenue, costs, commissions
│   └── System configuration: Settings, integrations, backups
├── Admin:
│   ├── Standard users: CRUD operations (not super admin)
│   ├── All projects: Business data access and management  
│   ├── Financial summaries: Reporting and analytics
│   └── Content management: Templates, notifications, workflows
├── AE (Account Executive):
│   ├── Assigned requests: Complete workflow management
│   ├── Client communications: Email, SMS, meeting scheduling
│   ├── Quote generation: Pricing, proposals, approvals
│   └── Project handoff: Transfer to project managers
├── PM (Project Manager):
│   ├── Assigned projects: Progress tracking and updates
│   ├── Client communications: Project-related communications
│   ├── Resource management: Vendor coordination, scheduling
│   └── Project completion: Final deliverables, client satisfaction
└── Homeowner:
    ├── Own projects: View progress, communications, documents
    ├── Profile management: Contact information, preferences
    ├── Payment information: Invoices, payment history, methods
    └── Communication: Messages, meeting requests, feedback
```

**Feature Access Control**:
```yaml
Feature Permissions:
├── User Management:
│   ├── Create Users: Super Admin, Admin
│   ├── Modify Users: Super Admin, Admin (with restrictions)
│   ├── Delete Users: Super Admin only
│   └── View Users: All administrative roles
├── Request Management:
│   ├── Create Requests: AE, Admin, Super Admin
│   ├── Assign Requests: SRM, Admin, Super Admin
│   ├── Process Requests: AE (assigned), Admin, Super Admin
│   └── View Requests: All business roles (filtered by assignment)
├── Financial Management:
│   ├── View Financials: Accounting, Admin, Super Admin
│   ├── Process Payments: Accounting, Admin, Super Admin
│   ├── Generate Invoices: Accounting, AE (for quotes), Admin, Super Admin
│   └── Financial Reporting: Accounting, Admin, Super Admin
└── System Administration:
    ├── System Settings: Super Admin only
    ├── Integration Management: Super Admin, Admin
    ├── Backup Management: Super Admin only
    └── Security Settings: Super Admin only
```

### **Dynamic Permission Assignment**

**Context-Based Permissions**:
- **Project Assignment**: Users gain temporary permissions for assigned projects
- **Client Relationship**: Enhanced permissions for users with established client relationships
- **Temporary Elevation**: Short-term permission elevation for specific tasks (e.g., vacation coverage)
- **Geographic Restrictions**: Location-based access controls for multi-region deployments

**Permission Validation Patterns**:
```typescript
// Dynamic permission validation
const hasPermission = (user: User, action: string, resource: Resource) => {
  // Base role permissions
  const rolePermissions = getRolePermissions(user.role);
  
  // Dynamic assignment permissions
  const assignmentPermissions = getAssignmentPermissions(user.id, resource.id);
  
  // Context-based permissions
  const contextPermissions = getContextPermissions(user, resource);
  
  return rolePermissions.includes(action) || 
         assignmentPermissions.includes(action) ||
         contextPermissions.includes(action);
};
```

## Security Requirements

2. **Email Verification**: System sends verification email with unique token
3. **Account Activation**: User clicks verification link to activate account
4. **Role Assignment**: Admin assigns appropriate role based on user type
5. **Onboarding**: System provides role-specific onboarding materials
6. **Profile Completion**: User completes required profile information
7. **System Access**: User gains access to role-appropriate system features

**Account Deactivation Workflow**:
1. **Deactivation Request**: Admin or user requests account deactivation
2. **Data Preservation**: System preserves user data for compliance requirements
3. **Access Revocation**: All system access immediately revoked
4. **Notification**: User and relevant stakeholders notified of deactivation
5. **Data Retention**: Data retained per compliance requirements (7 years for financial data)

### **Password Management**

**Password Policy Enforcement**:
- Minimum 8 characters with complexity requirements
- Password history tracking (prevent reuse of last 5 passwords)
- Mandatory password change every 180 days for administrative users
