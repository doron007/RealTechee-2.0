# Authentication & Membership Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive plan to implement authentication and membership tiers for the RealTechee platform using AWS Amplify Gen 2 and Amazon Cognito.

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ What We Have
- **Amplify Gen 2 Backend**: Fully configured with 26 working APIs
- **59 Legacy Users**: Email/bcrypt hashes in Auth.csv
- **Prepared UI Components**: Header component with auth state logic
- **Data Models**: Comprehensive project, comment, and permission models
- **Authorization System**: Project-level permissions with email lists and roles

### ❌ What's Missing
- AWS Cognito User Pool integration
- Auth resource in Amplify backend
- User session management
- Protected routes and auth guards
- Authentication pages (login, profile, settings)

## Architecture Decision: Amplify Gen 2 + Cognito

### Pros
- **Seamless Integration**: Native with existing Amplify Gen 2 setup
- **Minimal UI Changes**: Header component already prepared
- **Cost Effective**: 10,000 MAU free tier (sufficient for current user base)
- **Scalable**: Handles growth automatically
- **Enterprise Security**: MFA, password policies, advanced security features
- **Migration Support**: Built-in user import capabilities
- **Modern Features**: Passwordless auth, social logins, WebAuthn (2024)

### Cons
- **AWS Vendor Lock-in**: Platform-specific solution
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs Cognito expertise
- **Migration Complexity**: 59 users need careful migration
- **Cost Growth**: $0.0055/MAU after 10,000 users

## Cost Analysis

### Estimated Monthly Costs
- **Current (59 users)**: $0/month (within free tier)
- **Growth to 1,000 users**: $0/month (within free tier)
- **Growth to 25,000 users**: ~$82.50/month
- **Advanced Security Features**: +$0.05/MAU (optional)

### Cost Optimization Strategies
1. Start without Advanced Security Features
2. Implement social logins to reduce auth calls
3. Use refresh tokens to minimize authentication frequency
4. Monitor MAU patterns and optimize accordingly

## User Migration Strategy

### Approach: Silent Import + Manual Password Reset
- Import all 59 users to Cognito with temporary passwords
- **No automatic emails** - users discover on next login attempt
- Login failure redirects to password reset flow
- Users click "Forgot Password" to reset manually
- Maintains user control and reduces support burden

### Benefits
- No email spam or confusion
- Users reset passwords when convenient
- Cleaner transition experience
- Reduced support tickets

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Backend Authentication Setup (Week 1-2)
**Goal**: Add Cognito User Pool to Amplify backend

**Key Tasks**:
- Create auth resource configuration
- Update backend.ts with auth integration
- Configure user attributes and policies
- Update data authorization rules
- Deploy and test authentication backend

**Verification**: Cognito User Pool created and accessible

### Phase 2: User Migration (Week 2-3)
**Goal**: Import existing 59 users without email notifications

**Key Tasks**:
- Export user data from Auth.csv
- Create Cognito import script
- Import users with temporary passwords
- Validate user import success
- Test password reset flow

**Verification**: All users imported, password reset working

### Phase 3: Frontend Integration (Week 3-4)  
**Goal**: Connect React frontend to Cognito authentication

**Key Tasks**:
- Install Amplify UI React dependencies
- Configure app-wide authentication context
- Update Layout component to pass user state
- Connect Header component to real auth data
- Create basic login/logout functionality

**Verification**: Users can sign in/out, Header shows real user data

### Phase 4: Authentication Pages (Week 4-5)
**Goal**: Create complete authentication user experience

**Key Tasks**:
- Create /login page with password reset link
- Create /profile page for user management
- Create /settings page for account preferences
- Implement protected route components
- Add authentication guards to sensitive areas

**Verification**: Complete auth flow working end-to-end

### Phase 5: Membership Tiers & Permissions (Week 5-6)
**Goal**: Implement role-based access control

**Key Tasks**:
- Define membership tier system
- Update user attributes with membership levels
- Implement permission checking logic
- Update comment system with auth validation
- Add role-based UI conditionals

**Verification**: Permission system working correctly

### Phase 6: Testing & Optimization (Week 6-7)
**Goal**: Ensure production readiness

**Key Tasks**:
- Comprehensive testing of all auth flows
- Performance optimization and monitoring
- Security audit and penetration testing
- User acceptance testing
- Documentation and training

**Verification**: System ready for production deployment

## Membership Tier System

### Tier Definitions
- **Public**: Anonymous users, read-only access to public projects
- **Basic**: Authenticated users, can comment on authorized projects
- **Member**: Premium features, enhanced project access
- **Agent**: Project management capabilities, client communication
- **Admin**: Full system access, user management

### Permission Matrix
| Feature | Public | Basic | Member | Agent | Admin |
|---------|--------|-------|--------|-------|-------|
| View public projects | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Comment on projects | ❌ | ✅* | ✅* | ✅* | ✅ |
| View private projects | ❌ | ❌ | ✅* | ✅* | ✅ |
| Create projects | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Manage users | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

*Subject to project-specific permissions
