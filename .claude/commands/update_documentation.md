description: "Create or update project documentation following enterprise standards"
---

Update or create project documentation files following the established documentation structure and formatting standards observed in /docs/* architecture.

**Documentation Standards:**
- Follow structured 00-10 folder organization (/docs/00-overview/ through /docs/10-appendices/)
- Use enterprise-grade formatting with comprehensive sections and subsections
- Include practical examples, code blocks, and implementation details
- Add proper YAML frontmatter with metadata (title, version, status)
- Use consistent markdown formatting with tables, diagrams, and structured content
- Include "Related Documentation" section linking to relevant files
- Add "Last Updated" footer with date and status

**Documentation Structure Pattern:**
```markdown
# Document Title

## Overview
Brief description and purpose

## Architecture/Implementation
Detailed technical content with examples

## Procedures/Usage
Step-by-step instructions and commands

## Configuration/Examples
Code blocks, configuration samples, practical examples

## Troubleshooting
Common issues and solutions

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Create comprehensive content with practical examples
- Use consistent formatting following observed patterns from system-overview.md, production-monitoring.md, and enterprise-deployment-procedures.md
- Include bash script examples, configuration samples, and code snippets
- Add proper error handling and troubleshooting sections
- Ensure documentation is actionable and enterprise-ready

- Include real-world examples and use cases
- Provide step-by-step procedures where applicable
- Add configuration templates and code samples
- Include performance considerations and best practices
- Document known limitations and workarounds
