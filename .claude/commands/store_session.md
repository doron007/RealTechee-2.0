description: "Save current session status and learnings to project documentation"

Save current session status and learnings, updating CLAUDE.md, PLANNING.md, and TASKS.md. 

**Requirements:**
- Consolidate information without losing context or key information
- Reduce token size with shortcuts or symbols that AI agents can understand
- Update completion status of current tasks
- Add any new discovered issues to the issue tracking section
- Update session summary with achievements and next priorities
- Maintain backward compatibility for future AI agents

**Files to update:**
- CLAUDE.md: Current session summary and achievements
- TASKS.md: Task completion status and new priorities  
- PLANNING.md: Any architectural or strategic updates

**Format:** Use efficient documentation that preserves context while optimizing for AI agent understanding. Tables columns should be ascii aligned (add padding and consider symbols are wider than charaters).
