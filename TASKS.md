- **NotificationTemplate Table**: Email and SMS templates with Handlebars variables
- **NotificationEvents Table**: Comprehensive event logging and delivery tracking
- **Lambda Processor**: Scheduled function processes queue every 5 minutes
- **Parameter Store**: Secure storage for SendGrid and Twilio API keys

### **Admin Workflow Integration** ‚úÖ
1. Get Estimate form submission creates request with unique ID
2. Notification queued with request-specific admin link `/admin/requests/{id}`
3. Email + SMS sent to admin team with "Start Working on This Request" buttons
4. Account executive clicks link ‚Üí direct navigation to request detail page
5. Full delivery tracking and event logging for monitoring

### **Technical Details** ‚úÖ
- **Email**: SendGrid integration with HTML templates and admin links
- **SMS**: Twilio integration with 160-character optimized templates
- **Security**: AWS Parameter Store with IAM permissions for API keys
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch logs + NotificationEvents table for diagnostics
- **Templates**: Handlebars templating with dynamic request data

### **Production Ready Features** ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ **Multi-channel delivery** (Email + SMS)
- ‚úÖ **Event logging** with delivery confirmation
- ‚úÖ **Admin workflow links** direct to specific requests
- ‚úÖ **Secure credential storage** via Parameter Store
- ‚úÖ **Template management** with personalization
- ‚úÖ **Error handling** with retry logic and fallbacks
- ‚úÖ **Debug tooling** with manual test scripts

## üîß **Task Management Guidelines**

### Task Status Indicators
- ‚è≥ **Pending** - Not started
- üîÑ **In Progress** - Currently being worked on
- ‚úÖ **Completed** - Task finished and validated
- ‚ùå **Blocked** - Cannot proceed due to dependencies
- üîç **Under Review** - Completed but awaiting approval

### Task Update Protocol
1. **Mark completed tasks immediately** when finished
2. **Add newly discovered tasks** to appropriate milestone
3. **Update status** regularly during development
4. **Document blockers** and dependencies
5. **Validate completion** against success criteria

### Priority Levels
- **CRITICAL**: Must complete for production launch
- **HIGH**: Important for user experience and functionality
- **MEDIUM**: Enhances platform capabilities
- **LOW**: Nice-to-have features for future releases

## üîÑ **User Stories 02-09: Ready for Implementation**

### **üìã Implementation Priority Order**
1. **User Story 02: Default AE Assignment System** - Foundation for all workflows
2. **User Story 06: Request Status State Machine** - Core business logic
3. **User Story 03: AE Request Detail Page Enhancement** - Primary admin interface  
4. **User Story 05: Meeting Scheduling & PM Assignment** - Critical workflow
5. **User Story 08: Quote Creation from Request** - Sales pipeline completion
6. **User Story 04: Contact & Property Management Modal** - Reusable components
7. **User Story 07: Lead Lifecycle Management** - Optimization features
8. **User Story 09: Flexible Assignment System by Role** - Advanced features

### **üß™ Testing & CI/CD Requirements**
Each user story implementation MUST include:
- ‚úÖ **560+ E2E Tests** (Frontend, Backend, Integration, Performance)
- ‚úÖ **Cross-browser Testing** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- ‚úÖ **Mobile Responsiveness** testing across all devices
- ‚úÖ **Accessibility Testing** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- ‚úÖ **Performance Testing** with load and stress scenarios
- ‚úÖ **Security Testing** for authentication and data protection
- ‚úÖ **CI/CD Integration** with automated test execution
- ‚úÖ **Test Data Management** with cleanup and isolation

### **üö® Critical Implementation Notes**
