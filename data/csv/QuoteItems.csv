at subject property to determine moisture content of suspect water damaged building materials.
If the the reading  will exhibit elevated moisture content it will require microbial contamination.
Air samples for total airborne mold spore count will be  collected during the subject property investigation. 
The indoor samples will be collected collected to ascertain the possibility of greater contamination to the breathable air within the subject building following the initial findings of water damage and suspect moisture stains within the building substrates. 
An outdoor samples will be  collected from the surrounding of the building for use as background reading for comparative analysis.

NLS sub will remove previous and continued wet building materials 
 The presence of mold growth reservoirs and elevated airborne mold spores within human habitations is abnormal and may adversely impact the health of some occupants.
Therefore, prompt remediation must be preformed.

The process:
Place 600 CFM air scrubber inside the proper containment of the water 
areas (per the report)
Window sills, drywalls, baseboards, molding ,stucco
Remove and dispose of all stained drywall ceiling 5 feet by 5 feet .

Professionally clean all exposed wood framing surfaces. Cleaning typically involves hand sanding or power wire brushing, HEPA vacuuming, and wet wiping of all the exposed building material surfaces inside the containment, including biocide wet wipe down of
the enclosure plastic.

Upon completion of above remediation, final wet wipe all surfaces inside enclosure, change HEPA filter, air scrub ON LOW setting an additional 24 hours prior to AE post remediation inspection and testing.

Visual investigation revealing an absence of visible dust, debris, and visible-suspect mold
growth;
All previously wet building materials are documented to be less than 20% measured moisture equivalency.

Concentration of mold spores and hyphal fragments detected on building materials surfaces is to not exceed the category “Low”;

The concentrations of airborne fungal spores and hyphal fragments inside the work area must be documented to be less than the concentration of airborne spores outdoors exterior
ambient air;
ØPresence of the Stachybotrys mold variety on any surface samples should be “<1+,” if
present, and less than 3 airborne spores/m3 if present.
The steps outlined here are the minimum steps required for remediation. The remediation firm
may take additional or different steps as dictated by their judgment and/or operating procedures
to adequately abate the mold contamination. In mold remediation situations, it is always possible
that additional hidden mold growth may exist in the walls beyond the areas investigated.

at subject property to determine moisture content of suspect water damaged building materials.
If the the reading  will exhibit elevated moisture content it will require microbial contamination.
Air samples for total airborne mold spore count will be  collected during the subject property investigation. 
The indoor samples will be collected collected to ascertain the possibility of greater contamination to the breathable air within the subject building following the initial findings of water damage and suspect moisture stains within the building substrates. 
An outdoor samples will be  collected from the surrounding of the building for use as background reading for comparative analysis.

NLS sub will remove previous and continued wet building materials 
 The presence of mold growth reservoirs and elevated airborne mold spores within human habitations is abnormal and may adversely impact the health of some occupants.
Therefore, prompt remediation must be preformed.

The process:
Place 600 CFM air scrubber inside the proper containment of the water 
areas (per the report)
Window sills, drywalls, baseboards, molding ,stucco
Remove and dispose of all stained drywall ceiling 5 feet by 5 feet .

Professionally clean all exposed wood framing surfaces. Cleaning typically involves hand sanding or power wire brushing, HEPA vacuuming, and wet wiping of all the exposed building material surfaces inside the containment, including biocide wet wipe down of
the enclosure plastic.

Upon completion of above remediation, final wet wipe all surfaces inside enclosure, change HEPA filter, air scrub ON LOW setting an additional 24 hours prior to AE post remediation inspection and testing.

Visual investigation revealing an absence of visible dust, debris, and visible-suspect mold
growth;
All previously wet building materials are documented to be less than 20% measured moisture equivalency.

Concentration of mold spores and hyphal fragments detected on building materials surfaces is to not exceed the category “Low”;

The concentrations of airborne fungal spores and hyphal fragments inside the work area must be documented to be less than the concentration of airborne spores outdoors exterior
ambient air;
ØPresence of the Stachybotrys mold variety on any surface samples should be “<1+,” if
present, and less than 3 airborne spores/m3 if present.
The steps outlined here are the minimum steps required for remediation. The remediation firm
may take additional or different steps as dictated by their judgment and/or operating procedures
to adequately abate the mold contamination. In mold remediation situations, it is always possible
that additional hidden mold growth may exist in the walls beyond the areas investigated.

at subject property to determine moisture content of suspect water damaged building materials.
If the the reading  will exhibit elevated moisture content it will require microbial contamination.
Air samples for total airborne mold spore count will be  collected during the subject property investigation. 
The indoor samples will be collected collected to ascertain the possibility of greater contamination to the breathable air within the subject building following the initial findings of water damage and suspect moisture stains within the building substrates. 
An outdoor samples will be  collected from the surrounding of the building for use as background reading for comparative analysis.

NLS sub will remove previous and continued wet building materials 
 The presence of mold growth reservoirs and elevated airborne mold spores within human habitations is abnormal and may adversely impact the health of some occupants.
Therefore, prompt remediation must be preformed.

The process:
Place 600 CFM air scrubber inside the proper containment of the water 
areas (per the report)
Window sills, drywalls, baseboards, molding ,stucco
Remove and dispose of all stained drywall ceiling 5 feet by 5 feet .

Professionally clean all exposed wood framing surfaces. Cleaning typically involves hand sanding or power wire brushing, HEPA vacuuming, and wet wiping of all the exposed building material surfaces inside the containment, including biocide wet wipe down of
the enclosure plastic.

Upon completion of above remediation, final wet wipe all surfaces inside enclosure, change HEPA filter, air scrub ON LOW setting an additional 24 hours prior to AE post remediation inspection and testing.

Visual investigation revealing an absence of visible dust, debris, and visible-suspect mold
growth;
All previously wet building materials are documented to be less than 20% measured moisture equivalency.

Concentration of mold spores and hyphal fragments detected on building materials surfaces is to not exceed the category “Low”;

The concentrations of airborne fungal spores and hyphal fragments inside the work area must be documented to be less than the concentration of airborne spores outdoors exterior
ambient air;
ØPresence of the Stachybotrys mold variety on any surface samples should be “<1+,” if
present, and less than 3 airborne spores/m3 if present.
The steps outlined here are the minimum steps required for remediation. The remediation firm
may take additional or different steps as dictated by their judgment and/or operating procedures
to adequately abate the mold contamination. In mold remediation situations, it is always possible
that additional hidden mold growth may exist in the walls beyond the areas investigated.
