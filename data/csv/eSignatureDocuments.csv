Cleaning typically involves hand sanding or power wire brushing, HEPA vacuuming, and wet wiping of all the exposed building material surfaces inside the containment, including biocide wet wipe down of\nthe enclosure plastic.\n\nUpon completion of above remediation, final wet wipe all surfaces inside enclosure, change HEPA filter, air scrub ON LOW setting an additional 24 hours prior to AE post remediation inspection and testing.\n\nVisual investigation revealing an absence of visible dust, debris, and visible-suspect mold\ngrowth;\nAll previously wet building materials are documented to be less than 20% measured moisture equivalency.\n\nConcentration of mold spores and hyphal fragments detected on building materials surfaces is to not exceed the category “Low”;\n\nThe concentrations of airborne fungal spores and hyphal fragments inside the work area must be documented to be less than the concentration of airborne spores outdoors exterior\nambient air;\nØPresence of the Stachybotrys mold variety on any surface samples should be “<1+,” if\npresent, and less than 3 airborne spores/m3 if present.\nThe steps outlined here are the minimum steps required for remediation. The remediation firm\nmay take additional or different steps as dictated by their judgment and/or operating procedures\nto adequately abate the mold contamination. In mold remediation situations, it is always possible\nthat additional hidden mold growth may exist in the walls beyond the areas investigated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"",""price"":19575,""id"":""0023c45a-c499-68b4-c527-2b2cb322445e"",""qty"":1},{""name"":""Stucco repairs"",""image"":"""",""description"":""Demo the stucco in all the areas that been indicated in the home inspection report.\nInstall new water proofing\nInstall new brown paper and metal lath\nApply new stucco and match to existing house color (as close as possible)\n\nBedroom # 2 - cracked lower stucco wall under the window\nMaster bedroom - elevated moisture level under the window\nMaster bathroom -water damage stucco\nLiving room - water damage under NW window\nLiving room - water damage under - SW window\nLiving room \n water damage under North windows\n\nFamily room -water damage under double exist doors\n"",""price"":14500,""id"":""6f3f9de7-9446-f0f0-f474-02fa907999ce"",""qty"":1},{""name"":""Drywall repairs & Reinstall molding"",""image"":"""",""description"":""Supply and install new drywall in all the areas that been affected by the mold remediation process.\nPrime and Paint the entire area where new drywall will be installed \nCover all floors as needed\nHang new drywall sheets\nInstall metal corners as needed\nTaping and mudding (cover all sims)\nApply texture\nPaint entire area that been affected by the mold remediation process\n\nBedroom # 2 - NE wall\nBedroom # 2 - Window wall\nInstall new baseboards\nDining Room -Around the upper round stationary window\nGarage - East window wall\nLiving Room - SW Corner window\nLiving Room - NW Corner window\nLiving Room - Upper stationary window frame\nLiving Room - upper stationary window frame\nMaster Bath - upper round stationary window\nMaster Bath - window above the tub\nMaster Bedroom -NW corner window\nMaster Bedroom - South upper round stationary window\nMaster Bedroom - West window wall\n"",""price"":13340,""id"":""89376482-147d-991a-ece4-271795c09cdf"",""qty"":1},{""name"":""Windows Replacement"",""image"":"""",""description"":""*Please note : Final prices to be provided upon final measurements.\nDemo the following windows /doors (listed below).\nRemove and haul way all debris\ndemo drywall and stucco as needed in order to install new windows.\nSupply and install new vinyl windows and stationary glass windows\nSupply and install double exist doors (wood)\n\nMaster Bedroom - total of 7 windows\nMaster Bathroom - Upper stationary window \nLiving Room  - SW corner window\nLiving Room - 2 stationary windows\nKitchen - stationary window\nFamily Room - double exit doors\nBedroom # 2\nLaundry room - replace existing window\nGarage window"",""price"":21141,""id"":""338fc38e-056e-4bc0-d68f-89b24b41956a"",""qty"":1},{""name"":""Facia Boards"",""image"":"""",""description"":""Demo all rooted facia boards\nRemove and haul away\nSupply and install new facia boards (prime and paint)"",""price"":7975,""id"":""8d03561f-6884-0901-450e-c23efadf6e96"",""qty"":1}],""Notes"":[{""text"":""This quote is valid for the next 30 days, after which values may be subject to change.\nLooking forward to make dreams come true.\n\nThe RealTechee team""}],""Documents"":[{""url"":""undefined"",""name"":""undefined""}]}",https://us1.pdfgeneratorapi.com/share/16332/8fa79e848bd7cff4c42298aec211b7be,"wix:document://v1/50dc93_dd522cece0b64e8094da58281d3ff96b.pdf/22101%20Cairnloch%20St,%20Calabasas,%20CA%2091302,%20USA.pdf",,,,https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/50dc93_dd522cece0b64e8094da58281d3ff96b.pdf,,,,,hstyler45@outlook.com,2023-03-06T17:16:55Z,2023-03-06T17:16:55Z,50dc93e3-0c5b-4b4f-8acc-ca2ec2619c82,42bc0a13-af18-4484-946e-7719f0a3001f
