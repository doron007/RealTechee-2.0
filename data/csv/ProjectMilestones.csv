* Fire proofing of light is not included - client is responsible. If requested A
Lighting Inc. will quote accordingly.
* * LEDs are extremely energy efficient and consume up to 90% less power than
incandescent bulbs. Since LEDs use only a fraction of the energy of an
incandescent light bulb there is a dramatic decrease in power costs. Additionally,
money and energy is saved in maintenance and replacement costs due to the long
LED lifespan. We recommend our clients to research the many more benefits
upgrading to LED can bring.","64",3,true,,,false,false
