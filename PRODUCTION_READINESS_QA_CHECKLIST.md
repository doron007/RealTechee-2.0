# üèÜ PRODUCTION READINESS QA CHECKLIST - RealTechee 2.0

## üìã **AI AGENT INSTRUCTIONS**

### **Testing Protocol for Claude Code**
**CRITICAL: DATA-DRIVEN SUCCESS ONLY - NO ASSUMPTIONS**

#### **Success Criteria**
- ‚úÖ **PASS**: Real data validation, actual UI behavior, measurable results
- ‚ùå **FAIL**: Console errors, HTTP errors, missing data, broken functionality
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **PROCESSING**: Currently being tested
- ‚è≥ **PENDING**: Awaiting execution

#### **Testing Methodology**
1. **Use Sub-agents**: Deploy specialized agents for parallel testing
2. **Sprint Management**: Prioritize critical path items first
3. **Evidence-Based**: Screenshots, console logs, network requests, data validation
4. **No Code Scanning**: Success determined by actual functionality, not code review
5. **Real User Scenarios**: Test actual workflows, not theoretical cases

#### **Execution Rules**
- Run each test against running server (port 3000)
- Capture console errors and HTTP status codes
- Validate actual data displayed in UI
- Take screenshots for visual evidence
- Record network requests and responses
- Test with real form submissions and file uploads
