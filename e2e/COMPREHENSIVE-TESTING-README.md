## 🛠️ **Advanced Testing Features**

### **Robust Selector Framework**
The testing framework uses **fallback selector arrays** to eliminate selector rigidity issues:

```javascript
// Example: Flexible form detection
const formSelectors = [
  'form[data-testid="get-estimate-form"]',
  'form:has(input[name*="agentInfo"])',
  'form:has(button[type="submit"])',
  '.get-estimate-form form',
  'main form'
];
```

### **Comprehensive Error Handling**
- Network failure simulation
- API error response testing
- Form validation error scenarios
- Browser compatibility testing
- Mobile responsiveness validation

### **Performance Validation**
- API response time monitoring (<2 seconds)
- Page load time validation (<5 seconds)
- Large dataset handling (1000+ records)
- Concurrent user simulation
- Memory usage optimization

### **Backend Integration Testing**
- GraphQL API operations (CRUD)
- DynamoDB data consistency
- AWS services integration (S3, Cognito, SES)
- Business logic services validation
- Real-time subscriptions testing

## 🔍 **Discovered Issues Resolution**

All discovered issues from TASKS.md have been resolved:
