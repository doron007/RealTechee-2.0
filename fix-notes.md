# RealTechee 2.0 Fix Notes

## JSX Syntax Errors (Fixed)
1. Fixed broken JSX in `project.tsx`:
   - Corrected the onError handler in the main image component
   - Fixed unclosed JSX tags and incorrect nesting
   - Removed references to undefined variables `imgSrc` and `imgSrcValid`
   - Completed all JSX blocks that had empty return statements
   - Added proper error handling for thumbnails
   - Fixed onError handlers in thumbnail Image components

```tsx
// Return the Image component with our safe URL
return (
  <Image 
    src={safeSrc}
    alt={`Project image ${currentImageIndex + 1}`}
    fill
    style={{ objectFit: 'cover' }}
    className="rounded-lg"
    priority={currentImageIndex === 0}
    onError={(e) => {
      console.error(`Failed to load image: ${safeSrc}`);
      // Convert the event target to an HTMLImageElement to access the src
      const img = e.target as HTMLImageElement;
      img.src = '/assets/images/placeholder.jpg';
    }}
  />
);
```

## Build Process Errors (Fixed)
1. Fixed missing build files issue:
   - Cleared Next.js build cache with `rm -rf .next`
   - Cleared Node modules cache with `rm -rf node_modules/.cache`
   - Reinstalled dependencies with `npm install`
   - Performed a fresh build with `npm run build`

2. Fixed port in-use issues:
   - Used an alternative port for the Next.js server (PORT=4001)
   - Application now starts successfully on the specified port

## Image Loading Errors (Fixed)
1. Fixed 403 errors with Wix media URLs:
   - Updated `convertWixMediaUrl` in `wixMediaUtils.ts` to properly handle Wix media IDs
   - Added code to append `~mv2.jpg` suffix to media IDs that don't have it
   - Enhanced JSON slug extraction to ensure proper URL formatting
   - Updated `safeImageUrl` and `extractImageFromJsonArray` functions to handle Wix URLs consistently

2. The fix ensures that media IDs like:
   ```
   daeed6_ec72c18577a645dfb96b5f6e892fd6a1mv2
   ```
   Are properly converted to:
   ```
   daeed6_ec72c18577a645dfb96b5f6e892fd6a1mv2~mv2.jpg
   ```

## Build Success
The build now completes successfully with all pages being generated correctly:
- Static pages: /, /about, /contact, /project, /projects, /style-guide, and product pages
- Dynamic pages: API routes

## Running the Application
To start the application:
```bash
cd /Users/doron/Projects/RealTechee\ 2.0/
PORT=4001 npm start
```

The application will be available at:
- Local: http://localhost:4001
- Network: http://192.168.4.204:4001 (IP may vary)
